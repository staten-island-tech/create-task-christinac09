ideas:
- can choose types of ques (MC, true/false, Sa?)
- can choose # of ques
- ask diff ques abt characters (guess char from info, which desc describes char)
- can pull characters/weapons(?) using coins gained from correct ans
- in middle/end of trivia, maybe have a part where user can do double or nothing based on current points/coins gained (gambling)
- stats for # wins, accuracy %, highest streak
- what they get for winning: 5(?) coins for each ques, and extra # of coins for highest streak
- include commentary for getting ques correct and wrong
- can also use coins to buy hints (eliminate ans, give extra info abt the char, etc.)

algorithms to use for personalized project reference thing:
- getrandomcharacters - has everything but selection not in loop
- drawwithrates - has everything
